The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Using HTML and Java Script I have developed a way to display the data from all earthquakes in the last 30 days. I have added markers and descriptions for each earthquake that has occurred. The colors correspond with the depth of the earthquake and the size correlates with the magnitude of the earthquake.
